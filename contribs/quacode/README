To compile Quacode, you have to install cmake. To setup the
compilation process for your environment, you can launch
cmake by invoking
  cmake .
in the toplevel Quacode directory.

By default, 'make install' will install all the files in
'/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/lib' etc.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than '/usr/local' setting the
'CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX' option,
for instance 'cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME .'

Then you can compile the code by invoking
  make
in the toplevel Quacode directory.

After a successful compilation, you can install Quacode
library and examples by invoking
  make install
in the build directory.
